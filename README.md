=========

Todo:
- implement the rest of the calls in JS to make a full request that actually prints [David]
- ~~rate limit login requests~~ [on branch ken-debounce]
- full list of printers with short name (display name) long name (string used to access it in the request) and short description [Ken]
- better styling [Robert]
- better Chrome icon [Robert]
- clickable map that filters printer list
- let user specify number of copies
- use location to find the closest popular printer
- get photos of printers :D
